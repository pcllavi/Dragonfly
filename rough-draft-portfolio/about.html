            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This website is an assignment for a web design course that focuses on HTML and CSS. It is called COMP126, or Practical Web Design for Everyone</p>
            <p>and is taught by Dr. Tessa Joseph-Nicholas. I made this website look like one that I hope I can make one day, when I have more time and skill.</p>
            <p>I want to make an online portfolio site similar to the way this is set up. Because I want to be a UX Designer, portfolios often become as 
            <p>necessary as résumés for professional experiences. I made space for both of these on this website, although both need work. I've always been</p> 
            <p>drawn to the creative side of things, and to demonstrate this, I added a collection of my digital art as well. I aim to eventually make a </p>
            <p>website just like this, but with more features and functionality.</p>
